# City Graph Route Finder

This project implements a directed graph of Latvian cities using a **matrix (2D array)**.  
The program can find a route between two cities and calculate the **total travel cost**.  
If no path exists, an error is shown. A **Dijkstra** version is also included for the cheapest route.

## Features
- Graph stored as a matrix  
- Route search (DFS)  
- Total cost calculation  
- Error handling for missing routes  
- Optional: Dijkstra shortest path search
